## Project description

A machine learning project that combines the KNN, SVM and CNN models to create a music recommendation system from the moozyc dataset by madkausingh.

## Dataset

The Moozyc dataset is a custom dataset made by our team by scraping songs using the spotify api and spotdl. The dataset contains music from various Indian genres like carnatic, sufi, ghazal, bollywood, punjabi hip hop and so on. The dataset includes details of a song such as the name, artist, genre and track id which is retrieved from the spotify api. The track ids unique to each song let us download the song directly from spotify using the spotdl cli tool.
